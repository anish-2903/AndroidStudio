## What is Operating System
**Operating System**

An operating system (OS) is a software program that manages computer hardware and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and software components of a computer system.

### Functions of an Operating System:

1. **Resource Management**: The OS manages the computer's hardware resources, including the CPU, memory, disk storage, and peripherals, allocating them as needed to different applications and users.

2. **Process Management**: It oversees the execution of processes or programs, scheduling them for execution, and managing their interactions to ensure efficient use of system resources.

3. **Memory Management**: The OS controls the allocation and deallocation of memory space, ensuring that each program has enough memory to execute without interfering with other programs.

4. **File System Management**: It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing and storing files on disk storage, as well as mechanisms for accessing and manipulating files.

5. **Device Management**: The OS interacts with hardware devices such as printers, keyboards, and network adapters, managing their operation and providing a consistent interface for applications to use.

### Real-Life Examples:

1. **Windows**: Microsoft Windows is one of the most widely used operating systems for personal computers. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) and supports a wide range of software applications.

2. **macOS**: Developed by Apple Inc., macOS is the operating system used on Macintosh computers. It is known for its user-friendly interface and seamless integration with other Apple products.

3. **Linux**: Linux is a Unix-like operating system that is open-source and freely available. It is commonly used in servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems, and it comes in various distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS.

4. **Android**: Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, primarily used in smartphones and tablets. It is based on the Linux kernel and supports a vast ecosystem of apps through the Google Play Store.

5. **iOS**: iOS is the operating system used exclusively on Apple's mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. It is known for its stability, security, and seamless integration with other Apple products and services.

## What is Linux
**Linux**

Linux is a Unix-like operating system kernel initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is open-source and freely available, making it a popular choice for a wide range of computing devices, from servers and supercomputers to embedded systems and personal computers.

Ubuntu serves as an excellent example of how Linux can be adapted and customized to meet the needs of different users and use cases, demonstrating the flexibility and versatility of the Linux ecosystem.


## What is Open Source
**Open Source**

Open source refers to software or projects whose source code is made available to the public under a license that grants users the right to view, modify, and distribute the code freely. This approach encourages collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development.

### Key Characteristics:

1. **Access to Source Code**: Open source software provides access to its source code, allowing users to study how the software works, make modifications, and customize it to suit their needs.

2. **Freedom to Modify and Distribute**: Users are granted the freedom to modify the software and distribute their modified versions, either for personal use or to contribute back to the community.

3. **Community Collaboration**: Open source projects often thrive on collaboration within a community of developers, contributors, and users who work together to improve the software, report bugs, and suggest new features.

4. **Transparency**: The transparency of open source software fosters trust among users, as they can inspect the code for security vulnerabilities, privacy concerns, or other issues.

5. **Licensing**: Open source software is typically released under licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) or similar organizations. These licenses specify the terms and conditions under which the software can be used, modified, and distributed.

### Examples of Open Source Software:

1. **Linux Kernel**: The Linux kernel, which forms the core of the Linux operating system, is one of the most prominent examples of open source software. It powers a wide range of computing devices, from servers and desktop computers to smartphones and embedded systems.

2. **Mozilla Firefox**: Firefox is an open source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. Its source code is freely available, allowing users to customize the browser and contribute to its development.

3. **Apache HTTP Server**: Apache is an open source web server software widely used for hosting websites. It is known for its reliability, performance, and extensibility, and it powers a significant portion of the websites on the internet.

4. **WordPress**: WordPress is an open source content management system (CMS) used for building websites and blogs. It offers a flexible and customizable platform for creating and managing web content.

5. **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)**: GCC is a collection of compilers for various programming languages, including C, C++, and Fortran. It is widely used in software development and is available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Open source software plays a crucial role in modern computing, driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and empowering users with freedom and flexibility in their software choices.

## Extra Terms
**Push Notification:**

A push notification is a message or alert that pops up on a mobile device from an app or a website, even if the app is not currently running. It's a way for apps to communicate with users in a timely and relevant manner, providing updates, reminders, or notifications about new content or events.

**How Push Notifications Work:**
- When an app wants to send a push notification to a user's device, it sends a message to a centralized server (usually operated by the app developer or a third-party service).
- The server then delivers the notification to the user's device, which displays the message to the user.
- Push notifications can include text, images, sounds, or even interactive elements, depending on the capabilities of the device and the app.

**Uses of Push Notifications:**
- News alerts and updates
- Social media notifications (e.g., likes, comments, friend requests)
- Reminders and alarms
- App-specific updates (e.g., sports scores, flight status, package deliveries)

**NFC (Near Field Communication):**

NFC is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other when they are in close proximity, typically within a few centimeters. It enables contactless data exchange, making it possible to quickly and securely transfer information between devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and NFC-enabled tags or cards.

**How NFC Works:**
- NFC operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where two NFC-enabled devices generate magnetic fields that allow them to communicate when they are brought close together.
- NFC devices can operate in three modes: reader/writer mode, peer-to-peer mode, and card emulation mode.
- In reader/writer mode, an NFC-enabled device can read information from NFC tags or cards, such as electronic payment cards or smart posters.
- In peer-to-peer mode, two NFC-enabled devices can exchange data, such as contact information, photos, or files, by tapping them together.
- In card emulation mode, an NFC-enabled device can simulate an NFC tag or card, allowing it to be used for contactless payments, access control, or ticketing.

**History:**

Push notifications and NFC were both explained and introduced in earlier versions of the Android operating system:

- **Push notifications** were explained and introduced in Android 2.2 (Froyo), released on May 20, 2010. This version of Android introduced support for push notifications, allowing apps to send notifications to users' devices even when the apps were not actively running.
  
- **NFC** was explained and introduced in Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), released on December 6, 2010. This version of Android introduced support for NFC technology, enabling devices to read NFC tags, exchange data with other NFC-enabled devices, and emulate NFC cards for contactless payments and other applications.
